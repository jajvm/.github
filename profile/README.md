Just Another Java Version Manager

Yes, its a dumb name for a dumb problem. The goal is to create the last jvm you'll ever need. The initial focus will be for windows, MacOS and Linux are not be a priority since [jenv/jenv](https://github.com/jenv/jenv) exists. I'm aware [FelixSelter/JEnv-for-Windows](https://github.com/FelixSelter/JEnv-for-Window) exists but it is very clunky.
